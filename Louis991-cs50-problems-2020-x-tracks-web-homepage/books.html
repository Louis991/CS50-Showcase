            <h2>1984, by George Orwell</h2>
            <p>A terrifying look into what could be the future. What's been more terriyfing, even, are the already many parallels between real life and what Orwell portrayed: unrelenting surveillance, the surge of totalitarianism; the state mandating the way we speak and write, which in turn alters the way we think; the fabrication of a common enemy used as a guise, by which a people's rights are stripped away with their very consent, among many others.</p>
            <p>Nineteen Eighty-Four has become a classic literary example of political and dystopian fiction. It also popularised the term "Orwellian" as an adjective, with many terms used in the novel entering common usage, including "Big Brother", "doublethink", "thoughtcrime", "Newspeak", "memory hole", "2 + 2 = 5", "proles", "Two Minutes Hate", "telescreen", and "Room 101".</p>

            <h2>The Forever War, by Joe Haldeman</h2>
            <p>The Forever War (1974) is a military science fiction novel by American author Joe Haldeman, telling the contemplative story about human soldiers fighting an interstellar war against an alien civilization known as the Taurans. It portrays the senselessness of war, the importance of individuality and of free will in the face of authoritarian government and social pressures.</p>
            <p>The novel is widely perceived to be a portrayal of the author's military service during the Vietnam War, and has been called an account of his war experiences written through a space opera filter.</p>

            <h2>Free to Choose: A Personal Statement, by Milton and Rose D. Friedman</h2>
            <p>Free to Choose: A Personal Statement maintains that the free market works best for all members of a society, provides examples of how the free market engenders prosperity, and maintains that it can solve problems where other approaches have failed. For me, it was a gateway and an introduction to laissez-faire economics, liberalism and explains socialism and populism as the traps that they are.</p>
